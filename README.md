#### Automated Psychometrics ####
Toward Valid Assessments and Educational Research

## Introduction
Welcome to Automated Psychometrics, a novel website that allows test developers, educational institutions, and researchers to:

(1) Improve the quality of student assessments and developmental rubrics,

(2) Gain valuable information about student development and learning, and,

(3) Carry out high quality research and analytics.

## Design
The website provides automated Rasch-based analysis of student test data, inclusive of (1) uni-dimensional Rasch analysis, (2) many facets analysis (to explore item bias), and (3) Rasch equating for developing common ability scales across different test forms. The website also provides extended options such as (1) inter-rater reliability analysis, and (2) automated ANOVA-based procedures to explore differences in performance outcomes between groups.

## Team Vision
Together, the team draws on extensive expertise in educational and psychological assessment, statistics, quantitative research methods, statistical programming, web-design, statistical software development, teaching pedagogy, and online learning. Drawing up this multi-disciplinary skillset, the team's visions is to both promote and make high quality assessment and research ubiquitously accessible to the developed and developing world.

## Use
The website and all functionality was built using the open-source R programming language and received no external funding. Use of the website is free and users may make use of the following citation:
